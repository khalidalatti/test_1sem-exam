        <h3 class="h3"> Adobe illustrator assignment</h3>
           <p>In the programme Adobe Illustrator, we received a quite different assignment that was targeted the Fabrication Laboratory on UCL. The assignment was to create a logo/image or anything that could be impregnated on a piece of wood. I chose the well known Fendi Logo, that i made into a pattering on the programmed, which then was adjusted to the size of a keychain with my initials in the middle and hole on the top, so it could be linked to my other keys.</p>

         <h3 class="h3">Adobe In Design </h3>
           <p>We had a few assignments in Adobe In Design, where we could create anything that crossed our minds. I thought of making a magazine frontpage, the pictures are from some vacations i was on earlier this year. I’ve illustrated the pictures through Adobe Capture and made them as png’s with different background colours. After the pictures was chosen to the frontpage i selected a unique font that i think would look cool on a magazine front, and then it was just typing and choosing the correct colours. The results is illustrated on the image.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Prototyping</h3>
        
           <p>In this workshop we had to work in groups of 4. Where each group had to create a dating app, with the programme Adobe XD and thereafter make a prototype that showed the concepts idea. Each group had a specific targed group which the app had to be built up after. My group got 80+, which means elderly people. I came up with the name “Haps” and showed the group my version of how the app should’ve looked in Adobe XD. We went with my idea and personally I think it was a great workshop and very different from the other.</p>
